Great. Everything a Northern company wishes to sell to ireland suddenly gets really expensive and slow. Thats something like a third of what they export (the EU accounting for over 50%). They are also at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to shipping goods to mainland UK so it's not like they will replace thsoe exports.  \n\nI read somewhere that Britain subsidises the north to the tune of 10 billion p\/a and you can imagine the loss of a major trading partner for them will mean they need more money. Trouble is, the rest of the Uk will have lost their main trading partners too so they will also need more money. Guess who'll be back of the queue? The North. \n\nWe'll hit a bump, but it's in the EU's interest to see us be okay and they have the means to support us.

They're also not that stupid to pursue no deal, they know it would be fatal to the economy. \n\nIf they'd really wanted this to pass, they'd have put it forward early in the year when Johnson had the full support of parliament.\n\nThe reason they've proposed this bill at this specific time is  to put pressure on the EU negotiators as they approach the deadline. It gives the UK negotiators something to compromise on, e.g. the UK agrees to drop the bill if the EU agrees to drop their stance on fisheries or state aid.\n\nI think it's doomed to failure, as is everything associated with Brexit.

That's BoJo's \"blockade\".\n\nIt seems reasonably likely that BoJo & co intend have a lax animal hygiene regime after Brexit - allows cheap bad food for the plebs, irons out the issues with US food (which is also cheap bad food for plebs). They may or may not intend using NI as a backdoor into the single market for those exports of UK or US food.\n\nNot sure why this has come up only now - possibly BoJo hadn't thought through the implications before now, or it's part of the generally haphazard couldn't-give-a-fsck approach to the negotiations, or they were too busy screwing up their Covid response.

Bread no. Bread in France\/Germany is miles ahead. Granted it doesn't last 24 hours. But should Bread last 24 hours?","91":"Milk and dairy sure. Beef, pork too IMO. But bread? The typical Irish family loaf is full of shit e.g Brennans (emulsifiers, palm oil, imported flour).. of course if you go to a bakery it is much better but generally a lot of the bread uses chemical leaveners. \n\nUsued to live in France, there by law if you name your baguette \"baguette de tradition\" it has to be made from water, salt, flour and yeast (usually from a starter). Much more consistent and available in every bakery around the country, which are not lacking. Much easier to digest too. \n\nSpot on for the rest tho","92":"Bread? Have you been to France\/Belgium?","93":"Milk and dairy are best I\u2019ve ever had. Bread? Not even close. French bread is the best.","94":"Was only thinking this to myself the other day. Any of our dairy products, milk, butter, cheese: miles ahead of anything I've had from any other country. Butter in particular it seems impossible to get anything as remotely rich and creamy outside of Ireland. \n\nOur meat is unrivalled too. Beef is second to none. Superquinn sausages could rival any German wurst. Rashers and ham equally as top quality.\n\nWhen it comes to bread I'd say there's a lot more competition. We don't have very exceptional white bread options. A good baguette could beat a sliced pan from Brennan's like. But when it comes to brown bread again I think we're the best. I've never seen anything similar to Irish soda bread anywhere, and anything that comes close just isn't the same.","95":"I love Ireland, I really do and I think a lot of your fresh produce is far superior to ours but let me tell you: Your bread is shite. Sincerely, a German","96":"I live in Korea at the moment.\n\nYou have no idea how much I miss a plain white loaf that isn't full of added sugar and tastes like cake.","97":"I might be talking bollocks here but isn't the bread you buy from a bog standard shop here (except for soda bread) the same as it is in the UK? Like, the supply chain is the same?","98":"Milk, yes. Bread, are you kidding me? With the possible exception of a nice soda bread, it's generally not great here, unless it's foreign-inspired.","99":"It's all in your head or you're making some very poor shopping decisions (Stay out of Asda if at all possible). Lots of Irish meat and dairy on the shelves in the UK and most of what they produce over there is produced pretty much the same way, in the same climate as in Ireland.\n\nWhere the Brits fail miserably is the availability of a fresh sandwich made to order, the kind of thing you can get in every centra here","100":"After going through more countries than I'd like to count now (around 30), I will politely disagree with you. \n\nI think bread in Ireland is probably some of the worst, not bad by any means, it's really hard to f-up bread... but absolutely not anywhere close to what I have eaten in Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Italy or Balkans. \n\nDuring my 12+ years in Ireland I realised you don't really have a bread culture, minus breakfast roll, it's just pretty much a toastie culture. At least for all the people I've met. I wouldn't call Brennan's or Irish Pride a \"proper\" bread by any means, more like something you make a toast with. There is tiger bread and any other \"artisan\" breads, but I'm just talking about what most people eat daily as a staple.  \n\nWhat I will 100% agree on what Ireland does incredibly is dairy, especially butter, hard to find anything even close anywhere else I went to. Ireland also takes absolutely first spot for beef, in any shape or form. Also Irish garlic, I wouldn't be calling it the best, I think Sicily has that one covered, but it's just so specific and it never disappoints.","101":"The quality of dairy milk has degraded over time (same with yorkee) and now I just don't eat it anymore because it makes me sad","102":"I think the bread is shite here , most people eat white sliced pan which should be labeled as a health hazard .. I suppose the soda bread isn't too bad if that's your thing .. but other countries do far superior brown  bread imo with multiple grains and seeds throughout.. milk and butter are good alright ... Cheese is pretty rubbish considering what a big deal we make about our dairy industry and sure nearly everything else is imported","103":"Nah. Bread is definitely not superior in Ireland. Any European country I\u2019ve visited has far far better bread than we do here.","104":"Bread here is shite. Overly doughy and moist as fuck","105":"I had been to Ireland on my own in my early 20s and was blown away by the quality of food. When we visited years ago, I told my husband to monitor how the dairy, meat, and bread tasted in Ireland. We are from the states where everything is mass produced (or if not, expensive as all hell) and he agreed - so much tastier. \n\nThough he argued that Argentine beef was better. I can't speak to the comparison, myself.","106":"Lived in England for the guts of three years (Manchester and then London), was always surprised that the sausages were a bit shite compared to home. Not terrible, just bland.","107":"Bread where? I live in Dublin and barely found actual bread. With that I mean flour, yeast and water. No palm oil no sugar no additives. Good old bread.","108":"I disagree with the bread statement. The variety of bread in Poland is by far bigger and better. Having said that Irish butter rullez by far. Especially the Kerrygold.

Also would say our dairy is on par with Ireland\u2019s","115":"In your head..","116":"Irish bread is very beatable. French bread is miles ahead for one. Dairy I can agree on. Irish butter, cream and milk is the best I have tasted and it\u2019s not close.","117":"I think a lot of this would come down to basically what you grew up with, and how often you eat it.\n\n\nI rarely put salt on my food, eating the likes of KFC tastes heavily salted to me.\n\n\nIn the UK they have gold-top milk (5%) which I haven't seen an equivalent here.\u00a0 Standard full fat milk in UK seems better, think it's a higher fat content but if you're brought up on something else of course it tastes different?\n\n\nThere's also little clotted cream around in Ireland and one we recently found in Tesco was horrendous stuff or some seasonal version i.e. vanilla flavoured.\n\n\nLincolnshire sausages were always great, haven't had them for years now. Superquins are enjoyable but they're unseasoned if I'm correct? So to compare the both would be wrong - in the same way you wouldn't compare it to a German sausage.\n\n\nThen goto that German sausage point, a currywurst from Germany taste far better than anything you'd find over here.\n\n\nBread is the same here as the UK? At least for the standard loafs, so you'd be on about\u00a0 specific breads now, and a home made bread is probably 100 X better than anything you'd buy unless you got something from a proper bakery, largely down to freshness!","118":"Isn't Irish bread made from British flour?\n\nHappy to be wrong about this.","119":"Sliced pan isn't\u00a0 bread.

Have you ever eaten ACTUAL bread in your life?\n\nButter is amazing, no doubt about it.","123":"We have lots of bread here in supermarkets, shelves and shelves of it. But it\u2019s all shite compared to France. \nEverything else though, yep we\u2019ve real food quality here.","124":"Hah, you guys can\u2019t even enjoy a slice of toast without thinking about us x","125":"Milk (and dairy in general), and meat is incredibly good and cheap. Bread however... whenever I can nab a sourdough, it's incredibly expensive.","126":"You are bang on about dairy. Tried the variants in UK \/ Europe \/ OZ etc. and it just doesn't compare!

Quality of fruit and vegetables, besides cabbages and potatoes is not great in Ireland in my opinion, but I imagine that is a consequence of the climate. It is far superior to the quality of UK produce though.","181":"The cadburys is shite now too. Used to stock up on it when I went back but it's the same crap we get in the UK now.","182":"Watched an RTE farming show a few years ago and they were talking about the chemical composition of the Irish soil, chalk and calcium are in high concentrations especially along the east coast and that\u2019s why the horse stud farms started popping up from the 80\u2019s, grass fed increases bone strength.","183":"I actually don\u2019t mind butter abroad, but totally agree on the milk front!","184":"dunno about milk but hearing some saying there's worse bread than Ireland makes me shiver, is that even considered bread then?","185":"also beef and chicken are delicious in Ireland","186":"Paul o connell said the milk was good and only to buy dairy council milk.

Bread in basically any European country (besides the crumbling shithole next door to the right) is leagues above the stuff in Ireland. Some of the sliced pans are basically cakes in IRL nowadays. I\u2019m currently in Germany, there is a bakery every 500 meters and fair is fair even the worst one is better then some of the better bread in Ireland. Saying that there are a few actual sourdough artisan bakeries in Ireland nowadays and their stuff (I\u2019ve only been to 5 or 6) is FANTASTIC! There\u2019s one in Tramore (seagull i think?) that is playing in the premier league of baked goods!

Bread, not so much.","210":"Bread, milk, butter, cream, beef, pork, chicken, lamb is all significantly better in Ireland compared to Australia. \n\nHowever fruit and veg in Ireland is awful compared to what js available in Australia. Australia is quite lucky in that pretty much ever fruit\/vegetable can be grown in huge quantities in the country","211":"The further you get from Ireland, the worse the flavour of: Milk, Beef, Strawberries, Butter (thankfully Kerrygold is almost everywhere worth traveling to now) (and let's just say it: Ireland is amazing at Dairy).\n\nBut Bread? I can't stand our bread much. France has such better bread. Just about everyone has better bread. The only place I've been with worse bread than Ireland is the USA. I don't know who told them to take a cardboard box and add sugar, but I picture they're still having a good laugh from hell. The alternative to cardboard is making something sweeter than cake to the point where I might as well just skip dessert","212":"To be fair it's not hard to have better fresh food than the UK, they import most of their food and chains predominate.","213":"Meat is so good here too.\n\nWaiting patiently for the inevitable Irish BBQ supremacy. Ireland has all the inputs!!","214":"In the UK you can get \u2018Tin Loaf\u2019. Nothing like that in Ireland. But all the other bread is way better. Milk was better in the UK countryside, tastes like water here. And Ireland unfortunately doesn\u2019t do cakes well at all\u2026 Germany, Spain do amazing snacks\u2026","215":"The food in the UK is awful compared to Ireland I agree . All Dairy all bread and all meat is miles miles MILES better","216":"You're correct!\n\n I couldn't believe the colour of the milk in the UK.

Also cupcakes. They're out of this world. Looking forward to them every time I go to Ireland.","218":"I work with many multi nationals and they all unanimously agree that the dairy products here are far far superior than anything they would get in their countries (Serbia, India, Turkey, Egypt, Armenia etc....)\n\nAs for bread. Most.of it isn't great these days although I do think that Gallagher's is very good. It's made in Donegal.","219":"Our bread is better than American bread but not as good as German, french or a lot of other European countries.  Our dairy stuff is as good as anywhere, some minor pluses and minuses.  Fruit and veg is good and cheap too.  But that is also down to the government support for farmers.","220":"I lived in the UK for 5 years and agree, I was frequently disappointed with food whether it was from the supermarket or a restaurant. Everyone is giving you shit about bread, but for bog-standard loaf of bread for sandwiches it's shite in the UK compared to here. There was a blue and white packaged one you could get in Aldi over there which was half-decent.\n\n\nMy biggest issue with the UK were kebabs, even a highly rated kebab was crap compared to a low tier kebab here. It was probably more \"authentic\", but who cares about authentic after a rake of pints.","221":"Been living in Australia for over 3 years now. I cannot think of one food item, that is better here than its Irish equivalent. \n\nI hear lads here praising various foodstuffs. The other day a colleague was talking about the quality of the beef he\u2019d been getting in the supermarket lately and I was thinking to myself, \u2018Mate you don\u2019t even realise, you have never tasted real beef\u2019.\n\nWe get genuine (made in Ireland) Kerrygold here and my wife brings some into work. Her colleagues (and their families) have lost their minds over how good it is.","222":"I find M&S bread pretty good. Yeah it\u2019s frozen then baked in-store, and it\u2019s not exactly flour plus salt plus water only, but still very nice nonetheless. Lovely sourdough breads too.","223":"I completely agree, I also live in the UK and literally brought Irish dairy, meat and bread products back the last time I went on the ferry. I also got a massive selection of Tayto. \ud83d\ude02","224":"I'm living in the Netherlands and the dairy, bread and beef are not as good here. Don't get me wrong, it's not like North America bad but they just don't measure up to Irish standards. Milk and butter are just inferior. It's impossible to make toast with the bread here, it just goes to shite no matter how many different toasters I've tried. I have to go to a butcher and pay way over the odds if I want beef that approaches the quality of what I can buy off the shelf in the local Supervalu back home. Supermarket beef here is super over priced and not worth it.\u00a0","225":"Living in London can confirm my taste buds light up when I get home.","226":"In your head.  Its just the Guinness nothing else.","227":"I could never understand for a country who always goes on about tea how sh1te the tea is in England. Like I've never got a good cup over there. Then throw ya up UHT milk. Dirt","228":"You don\u2019t know suffering until you try to eat half-day old Italian bread with Italian butter.","229":"Butter","230":"\nMilk is pretty much the same. Dairy products more generally - Ireland makes some spectacular cheese but so do parts of the UK. \n\nIrish butter is unparalleled globally (I will die on that hill).\n\nBread wise - the staple Brennan\u2019s white sliced pan is awful shite, you may be able to get even more awful shite in Sainsbury\u2019s\u2026 but it\u2019s still awful. \n\nThere are plenty of great alternatives available in supermarkets here and local bakeries. You can\u2019t get good soda bread really unless you are in NI.","231":"I don't think I could function without at least 1 pound of dairy gold inside me a week.","232":"I live in a small 3 bed semi-d, where I\u2019m gonna keep a massive roll of tinfoil never mind a fucking bullock.","233":"[deleted]","234":"I keep the elastic band off the scallions, every elastic band, ever.","235":"I fired my chauffer and drive myself now.

Definitely doesn't need to be fancy brand names, but I find Penney's stuff to be shite for the most part.\n\nAlso, meal planning all the way. And then sticking to the plan.","242":"Buying clothes from penneys is a terrible idea. Not only is it supported fast fashion, but their clothes are shite.

These clothes aren't durable and start looking old and tatty very quickly. Better to buy better quality clothes which will last you much longer. The only thing is you need to buy sensible classy clothes and not just trendy fashionable stuff.  \nFor the very occasional event, I sometimes go to penny's. For example, I don't really celebrate Christmas because I'm not Christian, so for the occasional Christmas party at work, I might just get a Christmas jumper from penny's. Penny's is also decent for young kids because they grow so fast, you'll end up changing clothes fast anyway.

People forget that wages are higher here in the south so if the person stocking the shelves in ASDA is getting less money than the person stocking the shelves in SuperValu of course the products will cost more. \n\n- Acceptance - Like it or not there will be Protestant people who may be open to a United Ireland but they will want their culture and traditions respected.

They will eventually get too old to work and be stuck paying rent at the mercy of whatever the market dictates. We'll have childless senior citizens renting bedrooms. That is appalling and entirely the fault of greedy, useless politicians. Houses are not being built in any significant number to alleviate this. The notion of \"Ahh things will work out\" is foolish.

This is because Ireland is \u201ca more open economy than the UK, accounting for 60 per cent of GDP comprised of goods imports and exports, as opposed to 40 per cent for Great Britain\u201d.\n\nIreland is also more dependent on the UK than the other way round, with Britain accounting for 13.1 per cent of Irish exports and 29.1 per cent of imports, the papers say.\n\nSome 80 per cent of Irish road freight that reaches the EU passes through the UK. Any additional checks at the border \u2014 even one way from Great Britain into Ireland \u2014 \u201cwould cause challenges\u201d, according to the assessment.

Britain should be showing itself to be a dependable neighbour and friend in the future, and it is frightening that Brexiteers are even contemplating a move which could see stopping trade, including food supplies, being weaponised in this way, particularly given the uncomfortable historical echoes.\u201d\n\nA senior Irish government source said that a deal on the withdrawal agreement had already been reached between the EU taskforce and the British government, which included a backstop for the Irish border.\n\n\u201cThat will not be changing, under any circumstances,\u201d the source said.\n\nAnother Irish government source said that contingency planning for a hard Brexit had been under way for most of this year.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared if there is a no-deal scenario next March.

I can't attest to any health-defects but tasting soap residue on glasses when drinking water or eating food off plates that haven't been rinsed is disgusting.

Place them on the drying rack and pour boiling water over the dishes and rack to sanitize. She said at some point, that by and large, people stopped the rinsing. The comment about Fairy liquid makes complete sense now and it seems like the right time frame.  It was secretly appalling to me but I decided I didn't care. I'd eat on whatever plates were set in front of me and I'd wash up however anyone did it in their house. At my house, without any scene of course, we did the washup the way I had been taught: wash with sponge, rinse and place on the rack.","676":"Im a foreigner living in Ireland and honestly that's a thing I noticed with a lot of Irish people,I don't let my housemates wash the dishes anymore because of that\ud83d\ude02","677":"From the website...\n\"Usage Instructions for Fairy Washing Up Liquid\nDose: 1 cap or 1 manual pump for a 40 -50l sink.

They leave the dishes with soap suds and not rinse. \n\nThe first time I saw my partner do this, I said, I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t let you wash the dishes lol so I wash the dishes most of the time.

The Irish people couldn't afford to buy grain off the Landowners at the best of times, never mind during a famine with inflated prices. They grew potatoes because it's all they could afford to live off with what little patches of land they could afford to rent. \n\nTheres no big conspiracy theory with the Famine. The Irish people were forced to be reliant on one crop because of the harsh subjugation of the British, and the confiscation of all the land during Cromwell's rebellion. \n\nThat crop then failed. The Irish had no food. The British weren't bothered enough to even notice for a while and kept exporting grain around the Empire. They weren't particularly bothered about doing anything about it when they finally did notice until a couple of years in when they started importing maize. This was useless as he had no infrastructure to process the maize here. \n\nSo the cause of the Famine was the conditions the British forced us into and then gross negligence in the response from the Government","924":"I think you are missing a few key aspects of this.\n\nThe Irish people had no money.

I believe the famine hit landowners hard too, not that I'd care. Many lost everything because without cheap labor, no product to sell. Plus London put the burden of feeding the Irish on the landlords (Poor Law).","927":"The famine happened because the Irish had no money to make a variety of crop. They were uniquely susceptible to a crop failure because they were already hardly getting by, and the tenant system was stripping them of all they had. There isn\u2019t really a conspiracy other than the English pushing them down as much as they could.\n\nIt was an inevitable tragedy that some UK politicians took advantage of to push litigation, leading to a belief in the UK the famine was either not real or grossly exaggerated for political gain in the press. Helping the Irish was always secondary to their political goals. That\u2019s the only scheming that ever really went on there, the markets had plenty of food at the time. No Irish people could afford it.","928":"That is why many people are of the opinion that there was no famine in Ireland.

I got roped into preparing declarations and shoite, and it is not fun.\n\nSome highlights:\n\nThe GVMS was supposed to automate the offices of transit function for goods moving via the landbridge. Randomly some ports (Hull and Immingham, for example) are not on the system. Back in December the UK made the general customs helpline the one to ring for GVMS related queries. Despite contacting shipping lines who ship to those ports, contacting the helpline and contacting port authorities themselves way more times than I can count \u2013 not a single person could actually explain what the procedure is supposed to be in non-GVMS ports.\n\nDelivering goods to the EU requires a \u2018de-registration\u2019 step. Many businesses receiving deliveries don\u2019t have the necessary registrations for this step. In the past it was possible to do a manual \u2018de-registration\u2019 of goods by visiting an office of transit. Despite contacting customs authorities in four different jurisdictions not a single one could confirm whether or not this was still possible \u2013 in some cases the response was \u2018we cannot advise because we have not been given advice\u2019.\n\nThe Irish Revenue fucked up on the ENS. When this shitshow started a lot of hauliers thought that transiting wouldn\u2019t require an ENS because, frankly, that was the advice being given by the Irish government prior to January. It makes sense since the MRN for the transit contains the same information an ENS declaration has. It caught a lot of carriers on the hop that this was required, and it really makes no sense since the whole idea of an ENS is for goods when they first enter the EU (while for transit the goods originated in the EU in the first place).\n\nI have another beef with the Revenue on ENS. As much of a shitshow as the UK is, at least in theory it is possible to get your own access to online portals for making GVMS declarations. Different countries have different requirements, but in general the Belgian, French, Dutch, German, etc. customs seem to have this option as well. The Dutch are the gold standard with their Portbase system where even the smallest player can get registered to do the Import and Export pre-notifications. The Irish Revenue offer nothing like this, and their advice pretty much boils down to talk to a freight forwarder. But this is problem because if, say, a truck gets delayed transiting the UK and has to switch to a different boat a new ENS submission will be needed \u2013 and at present trying to get a freight forwarder on the phone out-of-hours just isn\u2019t happening. Compare to the Dutch where you simply login to Portbase and file another Import declaration and you can see where Revenue fall behind. The Dutch charge a fee which more than pays for the development and running of their system, and is the way to go imo.\n\nBut most of my wrath is left for the UK. What a shitshow. Border Force haven\u2019t a fucking clue, not a fucking clue. The introduction of the Covid forms confused the fuck out of some of the morons they have working for them, and the customs has totally fried their heads. What is the fucking point of the UK singing up the NCTS system if some of the people they have on the ground don\u2019t even know what that even is?? The worst part of is that if a driver tries to explain something some of them take it as a challenge to their authority, with even more shitshow results. Take the comparison to the French when their custom system broke on the Dover to Calais route \u2013 they scaled back their checks to keep things moving. The UK don\u2019t seem to be capable of displaying that level of common sense.\n\nThe scary part of all of this is that traffic is very much reduced compared to normal. This is a combination of Covid, the landbridge and companies playing wait-and-see. The problem is that the landbridge just isn\u2019t a long term solution. It loses too much time and costs way too much (over \u20ac800 for some costings I did, and that included \u20ac100 for customs on the landbridge). The amount of routes that were once legally viable that no longer are is scary (tachograph rules and sailings times not working out), and the list of problems for still viable routes is as long as your arm (access to showers, no whatsoever leeway in case of any delay, etc.). But all of this will pale into comparison to when a storm hits and causes sailings to be cancelled \u2013 with the landbridge the sheer number of available sailings after a storm meant the backlog could be cleared in some reasonable time, but with direct sailings\u2026seriously pity any poor fucker who gets caught up in that.\n\nIt is a shitshow. Some parts weren\u2019t preventable, but some were. Fuck the UK government, fuck Revenue and, most importantly, fuck the UK Border Force.","1164":"I saw Stena have dropped a few sailings off their Rosslaire-Pembroke route due to much lower traffic than usual for this time of year.

Would the EU press to set a hard border. Maybe, but unless they send an army which they won't, I don't see how it happens.\n\nThe British want to take back control over many things they feel the EU has taken ownership of, principally immigration rules and the free movement of EU people. They want to cherry pick their relationship with Europe. Britain wants the benefit of being able to trade freely with Europe which the EU cannot allow because of our open border. To do so would mean NI will just become the means by which non-EU international goods enter the EU market (free from tariffs, so a smugglers dream) which would just undercut the price of EU-made goods. The free movement of EU goods within the EU is a fundamental principle on which the EU project will fail, if Boris' efforts to undo the withdrawal agreement are entertained. \n\nBoris wants a better deal and is banking on no deal being unthinkable. He doesn't care about NI but in terms of the geopolitics and jingoism he can't be seen to lose NI to Europe. Even though it's an amazing deal for NI who with an Irish sea border would be able to trade in the EU freely and with Britain. It's an economic win win for them other than the understandable political and cultural anxiety it creates for Unionists. \n\nThe EU has to come down hard on the UK and not allow the Brits decide what goods are at risk of entering Europe. In reality they all are. The problem is though if a No Deal happens, it becomes Europe's problem on how to address it. \n\nThe best solution in all this is to have an Irish Sea border but paint everything as a win for Boris who got concessions from Europe so he can grandstand and herald the great British resolve and bulldog spirit while waving miniature flags. I don't know how that works though and my concern is Ireland will somehow be shafted.

We could well be worse off. Most of our gas hence electricity comes through England. If they have problems with gas politically they will have to look after their own. So we could end up with no power for a week. It'd be wise to have camping lanterns a way to cook and if you have a fire stock up on wood for winter.\n\nPersonally I do a lot of camping so have all I need. Just need to have simple extra food like beans pasta uht milk cereal...\n\nNot going g to spend more than 50 quid on it.","1355":"I like the idea of being prepared for a disaster. I think it falls into the hole \"it won't happen to me\\us\" feeling people seem to have about most bad things. Yes, most things aren't likely to happen but they can. So being ready in such an even is good planing and responsible. Being able to feed or heat your home for a time if that tiny chance of something happen, happens it's reasonable and smart to have something there to help your self out. Amassing guns, ammunition, buying egg or something every time there a sale so your broke, That's when I start to not accept the idea as much but it's not hurting anyone else. So I also don't have a problem with it.\n\nSolar flares, earth quakes, volcanos yes even super volcanos are a thing all these things have caused huge damage and it is a matter of time before something big happens. Don't cover your eyes and call these people crazy, is how I feel about them. having a \"kit\" with something to clean water, long lasting rations and different methods to take care of wounds and light fire would be smart if each house had in case something goes wrong your have the ability to last a few days untill we sort it out.","1356":"Absolute weirdos.","1357":"You can't prep. It's a sad male fantasy. We're a completely codependent society and no amount if canned tuna can save you.","1358":"I think if we experience a disaster so severe that it causes society to completely collapse, it probably won't matter a huge amount how much \"prepping\" you've done. I'd imagine the vast majority of preppers severely underestimate the actual challenges of such a situation anyway.","1359":"Full on preppers all come across a few sandwiches short of a picnic - - but I do think sensible preparations against short term disaster are a good idea.\n\nPersonally, I've got ditch bags packed, one for each member of my family. Each has a change of clothes, and basic survival supplies for 3 days. I reckon chances I'll ever need them are tiny... But with global warming and more frequent storms you never know.\n\nI've also got a box under the stairs with 2 weeks emergency food. That's a recent addition, but supply chain issues and global economic instability freaked me out a few months ago and I figured it's all stuff I'd use anyway, so what's the harm having extra? Once a year I'll move that stuff into my kitchen press and refill the box with fresh stuff, so nothing goes out of date.\n\nI think the most likely issue we will face in Ireland in coming years is likely energy poverty as power and oil prices rise... Becoming self sufficient in this regard is a much longer term project as solar panels and electric cars are a bit out of my price range!","1360":"It's sensible to be prepared for emergencies to a certain extent. Keeping a \"go-bag\" packed with cash, important items, and a few days of supplies you might need if you have to leave your house unexpectedly isn't a bad idea, for example; that can come in handy not just in the very unlikely event of some sort of worldwide catastrophe, but also if your house floods or catches fire or there's a chemical spill in the area or any number of other far more likely scenarios where you might need to get the fuck out with little or no warning. Similarly, making sure you always have some non-perishable food on hand is wise, as that can help you get by in the event that something prevents you from getting out to the shop for a while. \n\nGoing full \"prepper\" and digging a bunker in your back garden to store your stockpile of MREs and ammunition is taking things a bit too far, though. The chances that they'll ever need any of that are very slim, and if society did actually collapse, their bunker full of food and supplies would just be a big fat juicy target for all of their increasingly desperate neighbours.","1361":"I bought one month supply of milk powder for my infant daughter when the Ukraine war started. We always have enough rice, flour and lentils in the house to last one month. This isn\u2019t stockpiling for prepping but just normal shopping behaviour as the rice we buy comes in 20kg packs.","1362":"Have some wind up + battery powered camping lights in the event of a power cut. Gas cooker in the house, so no worries there if the lights go out for a bit. \n\nOpen fire in the front room, so if there was a winter power cut, we'd not freeze.\n\nBiggest disaster we had here was a loss of water for a week during the big freeze about ten years ago. I bought some 50L containers (wich I still have) and a drill pump, so I was able to pump water up to the attic storgae tank and we were still able to have showers.\n\nThat's about as far as my prepping goes. The other prepping for TEOTWAWKI is just nuts.","1363":"I subscribe to r\/preppers because I think most of the people into this stuff are funny weirdos","1364":"This sounds like a really interesting watch, what's it called?","1365":"If I can't be cool in this life, maybe I can be cool in the post societal collapse world! Then they'll all see!","1366":"Think it's pretty sensible to have a bit set aside. I lived in remote area of Canada for a while and everyone keeps a week's did because you don't know when there will be a storm that cuts you off for a while.","1367":"I was always into prepping. Then covid happened and all the worse happened which turned out to be not that bad. My modern view is that people need say to sell food so we need to eat it so the general cycle continues. I got a load of food stored and never really had a reason to use it. Even when things got mental the local spar of all things was still open as strange as that is. I've sort of given up on prepping. Few extra meds etc to have stocked up isn't a bad thing but my thoughts is that even when covid happened there was still shipments of meds etc making it here.","1368":"My SO got a bit into it a few years back - never too intense, just bored between jobs and I guess wanted to do some practical good for us both. Never completely dropped it  - built up a 'brexit bag' when it looked like that would be even more chaotic and we've about 3-4 months of food stored in our small house. \n\nI've been glad of it a few times, like during weather warnings and during supply chain SNAFUs in the last few years. I also remember a Guardian article where the author went to a prepper convention; one of the more reasonable heads there pointed out the naivety\/complacency of assuming our modern food\/logistics chains will never get interrupted in our lifetimes. \n\nIn short, while it's a channel for obsession or mental illness in some cases, I think most of us could do with a little more of it. Even the safest country is 3 missed meals away from anarchy.","1369":"I originally thought it was a genius marketing idea to get people to buy way more stuff than they could ever need. The people making money from the prepper movement were the companies selling stuff in bulk. So I just assumed they were behind it.\n\nBut now ... the world is becoming more unstable and our leaders and public services increasingly inspire less confidence. I'm losing trust in their ability to manage anything. So I've started to see things more from the preppers point of view. Their threshold for action was simply different from mine.\n\nI don't have a pallet of baked beans in my garage but I have bought first aid kits, solar chargers, candles, water purifying stuff etc. Basically what you would need if you were camping for a weekend. And that gives me some peace of mind that I won't be badly stuck if I'm without power or water for a while.\n\nI don't expect a natural disaster to happen any time soon but I can see some market or politically driven disaster happening.","1370":"Ive always wanted to be able to butcher an animal.  Never really had an interest in hunting but did want to be able to hunt.  Same for growing.

Just an idea, will be putting it into practice myself soon once I've bought everything I want in life.","1579":"Try to go as cashless as you can. What with contactless, apps, and online shopping, there's little reason to have change in your pocket. If you have to have change try saving them in a piggy bank or a jar and occasionally use them in a coinstar machine or even for the odd donation to a charity box or something. Put everything into a bank or credit union and at least then you know where everything is, it's monitored by the bank, and you can track your spending as easily as opening an app.\n\nAsk yourself \"do I really need that\". I often I'm tempted by the odd chocolate bar or can of red bull, but I tell myself no. Try to think \"what do I have at home\". If you're on the way home, and you know you can have a dinner there, avoid the quick bite to eat. If you know you're going be at work or somewhere all day, pack a lunch or bring your own coffee in a travel mug.\n\nTry to buy in bulk, even for travel. If you know how much a week will cost you, pay for that week up front. This helps by making you think you have less money than you really have, and therefore won't be as tempted  to get the odd thing. Same thing goes with quality. You're fooling no one but yourself if you think you're smart getting the cheapest thing that'll break in a fraction of the time as the more expensive thing. Cook it bulk too. So long as you remember to take them out of the freezer the night before, there's no reason you can't plan out the week on a Sunday.\n\nIf you want something, try waiting until you have more money than you need for it.

But I saved up to \u20ac1700 before I got it, so at least I had \u20ac600 and didn't have to wait too long to get back that \u20ac1100. Waiting is your friend. Why get the newest thing at full price when you can get it for cheaper and with more expendable income a few months down the line?\n\nIf you have to buy something, use it. You're going well with cancelling the Netflix, Xbox, Spotify, and Audible. I personally still have Netflix and Spotify, but I make a point of keeping them and using them.

This stops over crowding as everyone would have to be seated at a table and also that there would have to be table service in place to avoid crowds gathering at the bar. This is unfair on publicans who's premesis isn't suited to these rules but u can see a logic to them.

Something that would make a class of 20 IT students go \"wow\" or just laugh their arses off.**\n\nOk, possibly interesting for IT students: Ireland had the first documented copyright dispute. Nearly 1500 years ago. I'll keep it as short as I can.\n\nSt Finian and St Columba got into a disagreement over a prayer book. Columba had borrowed the manuscript from Finian and secretly copied it with the intention of keeping the copy for his own use. But Finian said no, that this was theft--illegal copying! He demanded that Columba hand over the copy he had made.\n\nFinian took the matter to the High King of Ireland, King Diarmait. Finian's argument was simple: My book. You can't copy it. \n\nColumba's response was pretty familiar to modern ears: that the book had not suffered by his copying. He argued that to not share knowledge was a far greater offense than to copy a book that lost nothing by being copied.\n\nBut the king ruled in Finian's favor, famously saying, \"To every cow belongs its calf; to every book its copy.\" In other words, every copy of a book belonged to the owner of the original book.","1645":"Thank you all for your great imput.

The worst that could happen is slightly less variety of packaged goods from the UK. The free movement of people predates the EU and I don't think its on the table, so the UK border should remain open.\n\nOverall, while undoubtedly there are some risks or uncertainty if it goes badly, it's absolutely not necessarily to worry.

No \u20ac9.99 Ryanair specials even during normal times.","2040":"Unfortunately low Covid isn't a strategy that works here either.","2041":"> Cast your mind back to where the UK and hence North was last summer. \n\nWe sped up our opening up before the North last early June. And we gave them no warning that we were about to do that.\n\nIreland\nhttps:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-52937895\n\nNorthern Ireland\nhttps:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-52925516\n\n**WE** led to public pressure in Northern Ireland to reopen sooner. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until July when we deferred a phase (again without consulting them) that the North was considerably less strict than us.\n\nThe difference between what we (as a whole island) did last summer and Zero Covid was just travel restrictions(Hotel quarantine) and **funding public health teams** and maintaining our expanded track and trace teams as part of that. If you look at genomic data from before the summer and after we can see that the covid that spread was reintroduced to Ireland. We did the long gruelling part of zero covid but we didn\u2019t try to work with the North and the UK and do the final steps.\n\nSo I\u2019m fed up with people using the North as a boogeyman while we do nothing to work with them. Which we should be doing no matter what strategy we adopt\/continue with.\n\nAs for using them as an excuse now consider what will happen here if the North re-opens as soon as **their** vulnerable are vaccinated and they don\u2019t try to control covid in younger groups. Cases there would skyrocket and people here would cross the border to go to pubs and shopping or to work there. Their hospitals would avoid being overwhelmed but we would need to impose restrictions on the border to stop ours from being overwhelmed. \n\nNow so far that is **not** what the North has planned. But I still see no evidence that we are working with them to encourage them not to.\n\nDoes that mean I think Covid Zero is achievable here? Probably not. So why consider trying? Because all of the building blocks are things we should be doing anyway:\n\n1. Mandatory hotel quarantines\n\n- We need that to prevent variants from arriving and we can at least match the UK policy. (Right now we\u2019re actually a back door in to them)\n\n2. Massively funding public health teams.\n\n- This massively improves a suppression strategy and it\u2019s hard to argue that that funding is wasted\n\n3. a. We work with the UK and North on shared policies.\n\n-If we can work with them we should and it will make any strategy better.\n\nb. We curtail movement near the border\n\n-If we actually try to work with them but they want to be much less strict we will need to curtail movement just for suppression. In suppression that\u2019ll probably come as non-border counties being at a lower level than border counties.","2042":"I agree.

How does he know you didn't just see him pick it up and are trying to claim it even though you didn't drop it yourself.

That much rent for a studio apartment is a lot - are you staying in Dublin? \n\nThe main things are:\n\n* Electricity: Highly variable, depends on whether your place will have electric heating, electric cooker, oven and shower, etc. Check this link out to get prices for the main electric companies https:\/\/www.bonkers.ie\/compare-gas-electricity-prices\/\n\n* Gas: if some appliances are run on gas it might be good idea to get one energy company that covers both electric+gas (see link above)\n\n* Water (right now there are no water charges, but these will be happening later this year or next. Prices aren't known). The old charges that are on hold for the time being were http:\/\/www.water.ie\/billing-and-charges\/charges\/\n\n* Internet: Depends on what speed you can afford and where you'll be staying. Check here for locations and prices: https:\/\/switcher.ie\/broadband\/\n\n* Waste: Bins may be covered by your landlord, but if not you'll need to pay anywhere from \u20ac120-300 a year. This all depends on where you'll be living and what size bins are needed.  \n\n* Other considerations:  \n- If you're planning on working here, you'll need to get a PPS number as soon as you can.  http:\/\/www.welfare.ie\/en\/Pages\/Personal-Public-Service-Number-How-to-Apply.aspx\n\n- Most employers and some letting agencies will only pay into an Irish account or accept pay from Irish account in \u20acs. You'll probably need to get an Irish bank account. http:\/\/compare.consumerhelp.ie\/CurrentAccount\n\n- For anything else check out citizensinformation.ie and specifically http:\/\/www.citizensinformation.ie\/en\/moving_country\/moving_to_ireland\/","2092":"If you can get a place at that price you can live for about 900 p\/m depending on exactly how you spend yer money, and if you're frugal. \n\nRent will probably include bin charges, after that it's electricity, water, internet food, phone, and tv are the general bills. Paying for tv separately can be pricey here. Any other obligations will also have to be factored in like credit card and car payments etc.\n\nLocal property tax is for owners, you don't need to worry about that.","2093":"Can you show me the links to the \u20ac500 flats in Blanchardstown please?

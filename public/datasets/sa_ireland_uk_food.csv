So you exit with no deal and we have to put up a land border between North and South. Great. Everything a Northern company wishes to sell to ireland suddenly gets really expensive and slow.

They are also at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to shipping goods to mainland UK so it's not like they will replace thsoe exports.  

I read somewhere that Britain subsidises the north to the tune of 10 billion p/a and you can imagine the loss of a major trading partner for them will mean they need more money. Trouble is, the rest of the Uk will have lost their main trading partners too so they will also need more money. Guess who'll be back of the queue? The North.

The reason they've proposed this bill at this specific time is  to put pressure on the EU negotiators as they approach the deadline. It gives the UK negotiators something to compromise on, e.g. the UK agrees to drop the bill if the EU agrees to drop their stance on fisheries or state aid.

51,">EU is threatening 'blockade' on British food to Northern Ireland and to 'carve up' the UK, Boris Johnson says 

Stripped of the emotive language, this is not entirely inaccurate, bizarre as that seems. 

If the UK fails to have an adequate animal hygiene regime in place, it won't be allowed to export animal products into the single market - which includes, under the terms of the NI protocol, NI. That's BoJo's ""blockade"".

It seems reasonably likely that BoJo & co intend have a lax animal hygiene regime after Brexit - allows cheap bad food for the plebs, irons out the issues with US food (which is also cheap bad food for plebs). They may or may not intend using NI as a backdoor into the single market for those exports of UK or US food.

Not sure why this has come up only now - possibly BoJo hadn't thought through the implications before now, or it's part of the generally haphazard couldn't-give-a-fsck approach to the negotiations, or they were too busy screwing up their Covid response.

I think bread in Ireland is probably some of the worst, not bad by any means, it's really hard to f-up bread... but absolutely not anywhere close to what I have eaten in Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Italy or Balkans. 

During my 12+ years in Ireland I realised you don't really have a bread culture, minus breakfast roll, it's just pretty much a toastie culture. At least for all the people I've met. I wouldn't call Brennan's or Irish Pride a ""proper"" bread by any means, more like something you make a toast with. There is tiger bread and any other ""artisan"" breads, but I'm just talking about what most people eat daily as a staple.  

What I will 100% agree on what Ireland does incredibly is dairy, especially butter, hard to find anything even close anywhere else I went to.

In the UK they have gold-top milk (5%) which I haven't seen an equivalent here.  Standard full fat milk in UK seems better, think it's a higher fat content but if you're brought up on something else of course it tastes different?


There's also little clotted cream around in Ireland and one we recently found in Tesco was horrendous stuff or some seasonal version i.e. vanilla flavoured.


Lincolnshire sausages were always great, haven't had them for years now. Superquins are enjoyable but they're unseasoned if I'm correct? So to compare the both would be wrong - in the same way you wouldn't compare it to a German sausage.


Then goto that German sausage point, a currywurst from Germany taste far better than anything you'd find over here.

Alot of those on either side have a romanticised version of the UK or a United Ireland. These people will not have Thier minds changed. 

This in the middle will look at things like 

- Health Care - The options here are two public health systems that have their flaws, but you pay nothing out of pocket for the NHS, while the HSE is highly subsidised. Wait times, Cost and availability will count here. 

- Taxes - How much tax do you pay compared to wages, what services do you get for your taxes. 

- Employment opportunities - Can Ireland's success in attracting FDI be continued after a United Ireland, could Belfast become another major hub for multinationals.

- Lynx - Cost of living is important, while to compare prices does not take into account wages, costs of overheads and the fact ASDA can bulk buy on a scale southern companies cannot. People forget that wages are higher here in the south so if the person stocking the shelves in ASDA is getting less money than the person stocking the shelves in SuperValu of course the products will cost more. 

- Acceptance - Like it or not there will be Protestant people who may be open to a United Ireland but they will want their culture and traditions respected. That may mean having a discussion about rejoining the commonwealth, which would be largely symbolic, having the 12th as a bank holiday, changing the anthem, flag and how we commemorate our shared history.

The housing disaster means an entire generation are locked out of ever having secure housing. They will eventually get too old to work and be stuck paying rent at the mercy of whatever the market dictates. We'll have childless senior citizens renting bedrooms. That is appalling and entirely the fault of greedy, useless politicians. Houses are not being built in any significant number to alleviate this. The notion of ""Ahh things will work out"" is foolish. No, they won't, and for a very large percentage of people. People will get too old to get a mortgage. Life for many people is work, and have nothing to show for it.

I’m also in a relationship, and my gf earns what most would consider a decent wage although it is slightly below average.

we both live in our small home towns , she is rent free and I contribute about 250 month (this is far from normal). We both have cars.

Now here’s the catch - if we wanted to move out to a place for ourselves like any normal young adult couple elsewhere in Europe would do, we could, but we would have barely any savings. I.e. we would be living in the moment with low impact contribution towards the greater future. We are way too early in our careers to should have to take a mortgage on an apartment to achieve this.

For comparison, as a software engineer when I lived in Europe I was able to rent a brand new apartment to myself in a famous city. All while being able to treat myself and save comfortably. I had no car, but I didn’t need one because everything was walking distance of me.

The reasons for hardship are different now, but the end result is the same - droves of young people are leaving for better opportunities overseas, mostly to the same countries my generation left for (UK, Australia/NZ, US/Canada). 

>I honestly believe the future is really bright for Ireland and as someone from the UK, I am seriously considering moving here within the next 5 years.

And you speak as someone from the UK who looks at Ireland's benefits/advantages from that perspective. I hate to tell you mate, but a lot of the benefits you cite aren't helping people get by. A relatively small population, for example, is not a good thing most of the time. A small population in our case means that there are far fewer opportunities for young people, for example. And yeah, no one is invading Ireland any time soon, but your country did that and destroyed ours for centuries, and the legacy of that is something that we as Irish continue to collectively experience in quite a few ways. In terms of not having an ""awful colonial past"", we have something much worse - an awful colonial trauma that continues to lead to violence and polarisation in some places, among many other generational impacts. No disrespect intended, but being on the receiving end of colonialism is much worse than being the coloniser when it comes to a great many things.

Safe?? Have you been in Dublin lately?
We're more educated than ever, yet so many people still cannot afford to buy a house. In previous generations, a much lesser educated single earner could afford a house.
We absolutely have an awful colonial past, I'm not sure what you're talking about there. Did you forget about the Brits?

It means we don't generally take things too seriously, but it also means we don't hold anything or anyone to a fair standard. We really could be an amazing spot. We have, or had great geographical features (stunning scenery, lovely flora & fauna), but we don't cherish it. We start projects, make a bags of them, spend too much on the basics, and then move on to the next thing. We don't maintain what we build or purchase, but instead focus on the next big thing. 

We also excel at selling ourselves short. We're not good at upselling ourselves, and naturally see ourselves as the under dogs. Most people will blame history (800 years man...) but that's utter bollox, and just our way out of actually fixing the problem (if it's not the Brits, it's Fianna Fáil. If it's not Fianna Fáil, it's so other bullshit excuse).

When we learn to grow from our mistakes, and accept our flaws, then I think we'll flourish. Until then, it's all Cromwell's fault.

Article text:

Cabinet ministers and Brexiteers have seized on the papers, obtained by The Times, as they believe their contents could let Theresa May put pressure on Ireland to drop the “backstop”.

The papers say the UK leaving the EU without a deal would cause a 7 per cent drop in GDP for Ireland, compared to a 5 per cent drop in Britain. This is because Ireland is “a more open economy than the UK, accounting for 60 per cent of GDP comprised of goods imports and exports, as opposed to 40 per cent for Great Britain”.

Ireland is also more dependent on the UK than the other way round, with Britain accounting for 13.1 per cent of Irish exports and 29.1 per cent of imports, the papers say.

Some 80 per cent of Irish road freight that reaches the EU passes through the UK. Any additional checks at the border — even one way from Great Britain into Ireland — “would cause challenges”, according to the assessment. It adds that “political and social damage would likely follow”.

The papers specify that trade in perishable goods, such as food supplies, would be particularly badly affected. Priti Patel, the former cabinet minister, said: “This paper appears to show the government were well aware Ireland will face significant issues in a no-deal scenario. Why hasn’t this point been pressed home during the negotiations? There is still time to go back to Brussels and get a better deal.”

Lisa Nandy, a Labour MP, said: “Threatening Ireland in this way is as morally reprehensible as it is futile. Britain should be showing itself to be a dependable neighbour and friend in the future, and it is frightening that Brexiteers are even contemplating a move which could see stopping trade, including food supplies, being weaponised in this way, particularly given the uncomfortable historical echoes.”

A senior Irish government source said that a deal on the withdrawal agreement had already been reached between the EU taskforce and the British government, which included a backstop for the Irish border.

“That will not be changing, under any circumstances,” the source said.

Another Irish government source said that contingency planning for a hard Brexit had been under way for most of this year.

“We are prepared if there is a no-deal scenario next March. We also have a commitment from the European Commission to support Ireland against the fallout from a hard Brexit.”

742,"Imagine walking out of the loo after running your hands under the tap, placing a bit of soap on your hands, then drying them. Absolutely bonkers.

The whole point of detergent is to inhibit bacteria's ability to stick to dishes and hands so that they can be washed away during rinsing.

""In tandem, some soap molecules disrupt the chemical bonds that allow bacteria, viruses and grime to stick to surfaces, lifting them off the skin. Micelles can also form around particles of dirt and fragments of viruses and bacteria, suspending them in floating cages. When you rinse your hands, all the microorganisms that have been damaged, trapped and killed by soap molecules are washed away.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/health/soap-coronavirus-handwashing-germs.html ""

Soap is more effective than sanitizers BECAUSE of rinsing! 

""“The truth is that soapy water is much more reliable than liquids and gels containing high quantities of alcohol,” says Dr Corbett. “The reason for that is pretty simple: despite the fact that alcohol also works to break viruses apart, they miss out on the important aspects that help to carry things away from the skin. This means that whilst hand sanitisers do work well in a pinch, you might still be leaving some of the active virus on the skin. With all of this being said, alcohol-based hand sanitising products are a good substitute for soap and water when it’s not available!” https://www.qub.ac.uk/coronavirus/analysis-commentary/how-soap-kills-covid-19-virus/",0.8854,Positive

>The report released by the Irish Revenue Commissioners on Friday noted that a significant amount of customs duty came from imports from China, but it attributed the scale of change to Brexit.

Theres no big conspiracy theory with the Famine. The Irish people were forced to be reliant on one crop because of the harsh subjugation of the British, and the confiscation of all the land during Cromwell's rebellion. 

That crop then failed. The Irish had no food. The British weren't bothered enough to even notice for a while and kept exporting grain around the Empire. They weren't particularly bothered about doing anything about it when they finally did notice until a couple of years in when they started importing maize.

It was an inevitable tragedy that some UK politicians took advantage of to push litigation, leading to a belief in the UK the famine was either not real or grossly exaggerated for political gain in the press.

* The UK has vestigial colonial outposts all over the world. Ireland doesn't even control all of its own island.

* The UK has a very active miltary and is a key member of NATO. Ireland is militarily neutral and is a member of the EU (I don't know if I'd say ""key member"", though).

The reason is a lot of this is based on just in time and needs refrigerated lorries. Fresh peppers, butter, milk, tomatoes cannot countenance big delays or it gets dumped. 

It’s quicker to drive across England than it is to get a ferry to France. 

I hear anecdotally the lorries are optimised. Ie lorry brings beef to Uk, takes something else ie furniture to Spain and stocks up on tiles to take back to England, last trip is to take fresh produce back to Ireland.

1163,"I feel your pain. I got roped into preparing declarations and shoite, and it is not fun.

Some highlights:

The GVMS was supposed to automate the offices of transit function for goods moving via the landbridge. Randomly some ports (Hull and Immingham, for example) are not on the system. Back in December the UK made the general customs helpline the one to ring for GVMS related queries. Despite contacting shipping lines who ship to those ports, contacting the helpline and contacting port authorities themselves way more times than I can count – not a single person could actually explain what the procedure is supposed to be in non-GVMS ports.

Delivering goods to the EU requires a ‘de-registration’ step. Many businesses receiving deliveries don’t have the necessary registrations for this step. In the past it was possible to do a manual ‘de-registration’ of goods by visiting an office of transit. Despite contacting customs authorities in four different jurisdictions not a single one could confirm whether or not this was still possible – in some cases the response was ‘we cannot advise because we have not been given advice’.

The Irish Revenue fucked up on the ENS. When this shitshow started a lot of hauliers thought that transiting wouldn’t require an ENS because, frankly, that was the advice being given by the Irish government prior to January. It makes sense since the MRN for the transit contains the same information an ENS declaration has. It caught a lot of carriers on the hop that this was required, and it really makes no sense since the whole idea of an ENS is for goods when they first enter the EU (while for transit the goods originated in the EU in the first place).

I have another beef with the Revenue on ENS. As much of a shitshow as the UK is, at least in theory it is possible to get your own access to online portals for making GVMS declarations. Different countries have different requirements, but in general the Belgian, French, Dutch, German, etc. customs seem to have this option as well. The Dutch are the gold standard with their Portbase system where even the smallest player can get registered to do the Import and Export pre-notifications. The Irish Revenue offer nothing like this, and their advice pretty much boils down to talk to a freight forwarder. But this is problem because if, say, a truck gets delayed transiting the UK and has to switch to a different boat a new ENS submission will be needed – and at present trying to get a freight forwarder on the phone out-of-hours just isn’t happening. Compare to the Dutch where you simply login to Portbase and file another Import declaration and you can see where Revenue fall behind. The Dutch charge a fee which more than pays for the development and running of their system, and is the way to go imo.

But most of my wrath is left for the UK. What a shitshow. Border Force haven’t a fucking clue, not a fucking clue. The introduction of the Covid forms confused the fuck out of some of the morons they have working for them, and the customs has totally fried their heads. What is the fucking point of the UK singing up the NCTS system if some of the people they have on the ground don’t even know what that even is?? The worst part of is that if a driver tries to explain something some of them take it as a challenge to their authority, with even more shitshow results. Take the comparison to the French when their custom system broke on the Dover to Calais route – they scaled back their checks to keep things moving. The UK don’t seem to be capable of displaying that level of common sense.

The scary part of all of this is that traffic is very much reduced compared to normal. This is a combination of Covid, the landbridge and companies playing wait-and-see. The problem is that the landbridge just isn’t a long term solution. It loses too much time and costs way too much (over €800 for some costings I did, and that included €100 for customs on the landbridge). The amount of routes that were once legally viable that no longer are is scary (tachograph rules and sailings times not working out), and the list of problems for still viable routes is as long as your arm (access to showers, no whatsoever leeway in case of any delay, etc.). But all of this will pale into comparison to when a storm hits and causes sailings to be cancelled – with the landbridge the sheer number of available sailings after a storm meant the backlog could be cleared in some reasonable time, but with direct sailings…seriously pity any poor fucker who gets caught up in that.

It is a shitshow. Some parts weren’t preventable, but some were. Fuck the UK government, fuck Revenue and, most importantly, fuck the UK Border Force.",-0.9973,Negative

OK3’s new reactor is 1.6GW, which combined with the two 890MW reactors produce 14GW annually. Ireland’s annual usage is only around 4.2GW (from a quick google).

Until we find use for the surplus, I don’t think it’s a runner. It would be nice to pump it into hydrogen production or some other avenue to better diversify our economy away from multinationals, as well as to get energy independence.

1275,"If we get a No Deal Brexit, it'll mean goods should not move freely between the EU(Ireland) and the UK&NI without tariffs. How that will be implemented in unclear. 

Nobody here or in NI wants a hard border (between what will be the EU and the UK as a non-EU member) and I can't see either government agreeing to set one up. Would the EU press to set a hard border. Maybe, but unless they send an army which they won't, I don't see how it happens.

The British want to take back control over many things they feel the EU has taken ownership of, principally immigration rules and the free movement of EU people. They want to cherry pick their relationship with Europe. Britain wants the benefit of being able to trade freely with Europe which the EU cannot allow because of our open border. To do so would mean NI will just become the means by which non-EU international goods enter the EU market (free from tariffs, so a smugglers dream) which would just undercut the price of EU-made goods. The free movement of EU goods within the EU is a fundamental principle on which the EU project will fail, if Boris' efforts to undo the withdrawal agreement are entertained. 

Boris wants a better deal and is banking on no deal being unthinkable. He doesn't care about NI but in terms of the geopolitics and jingoism he can't be seen to lose NI to Europe. Even though it's an amazing deal for NI who with an Irish sea border would be able to trade in the EU freely and with Britain. It's an economic win win for them other than the understandable political and cultural anxiety it creates for Unionists. 

The EU has to come down hard on the UK and not allow the Brits decide what goods are at risk of entering Europe. In reality they all are. The problem is though if a No Deal happens, it becomes Europe's problem on how to address it. 

The best solution in all this is to have an Irish Sea border but paint everything as a win for Boris who got concessions from Europe so he can grandstand and herald the great British resolve and bulldog spirit while waving miniature flags. I don't know how that works though and my concern is Ireland will somehow be shafted.

Keeping a ""go-bag"" packed with cash, important items, and a few days of supplies you might need if you have to leave your house unexpectedly isn't a bad idea, for example; that can come in handy not just in the very unlikely event of some sort of worldwide catastrophe, but also if your house floods or catches fire or there's a chemical spill in the area or any number of other far more likely scenarios where you might need to get the fuck out with little or no warning. Similarly, making sure you always have some non-perishable food on hand is wise, as that can help you get by in the event that something prevents you from getting out to the shop for a while. 

Going full ""prepper"" and digging a bunker in your back garden to store your stockpile of MREs and ammunition is taking things a bit too far, though.

1579,"Try to go as cashless as you can. What with contactless, apps, and online shopping, there's little reason to have change in your pocket. If you have to have change try saving them in a piggy bank or a jar and occasionally use them in a coinstar machine or even for the odd donation to a charity box or something. Put everything into a bank or credit union and at least then you know where everything is, it's monitored by the bank, and you can track your spending as easily as opening an app.

Ask yourself ""do I really need that"". I often I'm tempted by the odd chocolate bar or can of red bull, but I tell myself no. Try to think ""what do I have at home"". If you're on the way home, and you know you can have a dinner there, avoid the quick bite to eat. If you know you're going be at work or somewhere all day, pack a lunch or bring your own coffee in a travel mug.

Try to buy in bulk, even for travel. If you know how much a week will cost you, pay for that week up front. This helps by making you think you have less money than you really have, and therefore won't be as tempted  to get the odd thing. Same thing goes with quality. You're fooling no one but yourself if you think you're smart getting the cheapest thing that'll break in a fraction of the time as the more expensive thing. Cook it bulk too. So long as you remember to take them out of the freezer the night before, there's no reason you can't plan out the week on a Sunday.

If you want something, try waiting until you have more money than you need for it. This is an old classic advice from my dad ""To spend €500, you'd need at least €1000"". I remember I needed a maryland bridge for a missing tooth. €1100. But I saved up to €1700 before I got it, so at least I had €600 and didn't have to wait too long to get back that €1100. Waiting is your friend. Why get the newest thing at full price when you can get it for cheaper and with more expendable income a few months down the line?

If you have to buy something, use it. You're going well with cancelling the Netflix, Xbox, Spotify, and Audible. I personally still have Netflix and Spotify, but I make a point of keeping them and using them. I even deleted my Stitcher because most podcasts are also on Spotify. It's still money going out but at least you're getting something out of it. If you're not used, it's useless.",0.2139,Positive

Coppers is a complete barn, as is Dicys. Temple Bar is just a tourist haven, but O'Donoghue's is good, quite touristy though.

Head to the bars on Dame Lane, its Temple Bar for Irish people, avoid Harcourt street where Diceys, Coppers and D2 are. Head to Camden or Georges street, perhaps Fade street too, the market bar is quite good.

Baggot Street is great fun.

For cocktails head to Dawson Street, Cafe en Sene and Sam Sara. For cocktails that are just as good and cheaper (€5 each) head to Capital on Aunger Street.

As for food, 

High end : Marco Pierre Whites steak bar, Shanahans on the Green, Chapter One, One Pico, Clif Town House, Restaurant Patrick Guilbauds or Unicorn.

Mid Range: Hugos, The Pigs ear (irish cuisine), Winding Stair, Matt the Threasher, FX Buckleys, Saba, Wagamama, Yamamori and Gotham.

Low Range: Check out the cafe/restaurants on South William Street, Georges Street and Duke St. 

Casinos, most fun will be the Sporting Emporium behind Cafe en Sene but for a great game of poker head to the Fitzwilliam casino on Fitzwilliam st

Check Trip Advisor too. 


NO: COPPERS, QBAR, SUPERMACS,DICYES and D2. Head to Temple bar but it will be full of tourists and hen nights.

Long Stone is a great pub and you should check out some of the bars on Dame st like the Bank.

I would recommend Dame Lane the most though, its great fun, theres even a trad session in the Stags Head that's not full of tourists.

Hope this is useful.

This stops over crowding as everyone would have to be seated at a table and also that there would have to be table service in place to avoid crowds gathering at the bar. This is unfair on publicans who's premesis isn't suited to these rules but u can see a logic to them.

I think the best way of working that out, is by comparing the cost of essentials as percentages of your income. 

As an example, I took the average Irish wage as per the CSO as 36,919 which will be a take-home amount of about 29,598. 
With that in mind, here are the essentials as percentages 

Rent 1,750. -  70.97% of montly income

Car 7,692 - 25.54% of yearly income 

Diesel at 1.26 PL - 0.051%. of monthly income

Mince 10.00 per KG 0.41% of monthly income

Milk 0.03% of Monthly income 

Pint of beer  0.23% of monthly income 

etc... 



On the other hand, the UK Average wage is only 27,200 with a take-home of about 21,844. With these figures you'd get the following:

1633,"**-So what do you think is one of the most important historic events of your country?**  
Most people will mention the Famine, or the War of Independence - but another important event in (recent) history would have been the [Land War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_War) and the subsequent [Land Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Land_Acts). These ended landlordism in Ireland, and gave the native Irish populace ownership of their own land for the first time since Cromwell. The two processes led to the solidification of organised nationalist sentiment, and gave the populace economic space to develop socially and politically. Without them, any eventual Home Rule would have been largely irrelevant to the Irish commoner.

**-Besideds guiness what is some other well known food or drinks of your country?**  
Ireland is not known for its cuisine, but rather for its natural produce. Irish dairy and beef products are sold all over the world as quality items - Kerrygold butter, for example, is the [most popular butter in Germany](https://www.statista.com/statistics/429504/most-popular-brands-of-butter-germany/), and [Irish agricultural exports amount to over €10bn annually](http://www.bordbia.ie/industry/buyers/industryinfo/agri/pages/default.aspx) to the economy (almost a third of which is to non-EU countries). Ireland is also the home of Fyffes fruit company, which oddly makes us technically one of the largest exporters of bananas in the world. Ireland's Tayto company are responsible for the invention of flavoured potato chips/crisps, although the Tayto brand is not well-known abroad, and there are farmers down in Cork making mozzarella cheese from Buffalo milk which is apparently [the best in the world](http://www.southernstar.ie/news/roundup/articles/2016/12/15/4131561-macroom-buffalo-mozzarella-is-officially-the-best-in-the-world/).

**-What is your current relation with the UK, and the whole Brexit situation.**  
Relations are friendly, and largely normalised now. We think they are mad and foolish to pursue Brexit, and are anxious as to how it will affect us, given that they take so much of our exports and we will be their only land border to the EU.

**-Who is the most famous Irish person at this moment (Preferably not well known outside of Ireland).**  
Right now? Martin McGuinness has just died. He was an ex-IRA commander and a leading architect of the Peace Process, so his name will be all over our newspapers, TV, radio, and websites for the near future. In broader terms, our most nationally well-known people tend to be politicians or media personalities. Gay Byrne is probably one to mention - the former host of The Late Late Show - [the second-longest running chat show in the world, and the longest-running in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show#History).

**-What do you consider your countries most well known music/song.**  
The music of Riverdance, or the Fields of Athenry song. They are not necessarily our best, but they would be the most internationally recognised.  

**-Any local sports or events not played outside of Ireland, or even just some small local villages?**  
Ireland has its own sports which are not just played in remote villages, but are actually far more popular than other sports like soccer or rugby (although sport is a big feature of Irish society, so any national team / player of any sport will be well supported in any big events). Our sports are Hurling and Gaelic Football, which are regulated by the GAA, and are played exclusively by amateur teams drawn from and organised by community and competing by region. While only recently codified, the sports themselves are much older - with mentions of Hurling going back to pre-historic times.
 
**-What is a most famous Irish phrase, poem or short story, that I could tell in front of class? Preferably in Irish, or with a very lousy accent.**  
Unless you already speak Irish, there's not much point in giving you a story or poem to tell in that language. Given that yesterday was World Poetry Day, you should read a poem by one of Ireland's many famous poets. Works by Heaney and Yeats are known all over the world, so you should find one that you like yourself. My own favourite is [Mid-term Break](http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/seamus_heaney/poems/12698) by Heaney.

**Is there a fun little interesting fact, event, person from Ireland that not many people outside of Ireland know of?**  
Ireland is known for having a good and relaxed time, but we have had [our share of important people too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Irish_people). We have three recipients of Nobel Prizes for Literature, two for Science (Physics & Medicine), and one for Peace. There are another five from Northern Ireland, some of whom would also identify as Irish. The [Father of Modern Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle), the inventor of [the Beaufort Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Beaufort), the developer of the [US and UK's first military submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Philip_Holland), the definer of [the electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Johnstone_Stoney), and the first man to [split the atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Walton) being some notable scientific examples of important Irish people. My own personal favourites are the exploring duo of [Ernest Shakleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton) and [Tom Crean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Crean_(explorer\)).  

Ireland's diaspora abroad also include many important people, with the obvious example of at least 22 presidents of the United States having some Irish ancestry. [John Barry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barry_(naval_officer\)) is known as the father of the US Navy, while [William Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Brown_(admiral\)) is known as the father of the Argentine Navy, and [Bernardo O'Higgins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_O%27Higgins) was the first Supreme director of Chile. The [list goes on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora)... 

For a fun event - Ireland still hosts a very large [matchmaking](http://www.matchmakerireland.com/) - [festival](http://www.thejournal.ie/willie-daly-matchmaking-festival-lisdoonvarna-2956396-Sep2016/) every year.",0.9979,Positive

> So what do you think is one of the most important historic events of your country?

The great famine and the 1916 Easter rising are the ones that stick out to me.

> Besideds guiness what is some other well known food or drinks of your country?

For drink it has to be Club Rock Shandy. It's a mixture of lemon and orange and it is just so good. There is an ale called Smithwicks (pronounced ""smid-iks"") that I can't get enough of when I'm home.

For food, batch bread, and not like your Dutch bread which by Irish standards is shite. Butter, Kerrygold is the only butter for me. Jambons, a pastry baked with ham and cheese. Sausage rolls, think of worstenbroodjes but even more unhealthy for you. And you can get five for €1! An Irish fry, two eggs, two sausages, two rashers, two bacon, two pudding, one black, one white. To make that even better put it in a bread roll and add ketchup.

>What is your current relation with the UK, and the whole Brexit situation. 

I don't have an opinion on the UK or Brexit. I haven't got an interest in politics. Even though I should.

>Who is the most famous Irish person at this moment (Preferably not well known outside of Ireland).

Daniel O'Donnell, infamous for flicking beans.

>What do you consider your countries most well known music/song.

B*Witched have to be up there.

But listen to The Rocky Road to Dublin, also listen to The Sick Note by The Dubliners.  Anything by The Dubliners actually.

>Any local sports or events not played outside of Ireland, or even just some small local villages?

Hurling is really only played in Ireland. It looks barbaric when you show it to anyone outside of Ireland. There is also Irish handball. It is like modern day squash, but with your hand.

>What is a most famous Irish phrase, poem or short story, that I could tell in front of class? Prefferably in Irish, or with a very lousy accent

""An bhfuil cead agam dul go dtí an leithreas"" is one phrase every Irish person knows. I'll leave you to translate and pronounce it :)

1644,"**-So what do you think is one of the most important historic events of your country?**  
The famine. Apart from changing the demographics of Ireland for 170+ years (population still hasn't recovered to pre-famine levels), the mass emigration profoundly changed the history of other countries like the US.

**-Besideds guiness what is some other well known food or drinks of your country?**

Kerrygold butter. Nuff said.

**-What is your current relation with the UK, and the whole Brexit situation.**

Relationship with the UK very good for the most part. Huge cultural ties and shared​ history, not all of which is bad. Irish people have lots of relationships and family members in the UK and often vice versa. Queen Elizabeth's visit here a few years back was a major maturing point in our relationship and mostly very well regarded here. Brexit: I think it's a huge challenge for us, and most people here think they've fucked up enormously with their decision, no different than the views of the rest of Europe on brexit, but it will affect us more.


**-Who is the most famous Irish person at this moment (Preferably not well known outside of Ireland).**  
I'd agree with Michael D Higgins having the highest ratio of recognition in Ireland to obscurity internationally.

**-What do you consider your countries most well known music/song.**
Hard to argue that anything is better known internationally than U2's major hits.

**-Any local sports or events not played outside of Ireland, or even just some small local villages?**  
Since everyone has said hurling or GAA, which are played in lots of other countries to a small extent, what about an event? The [Ploughing Championships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ploughing_Championships) gets 200k attendees every September, and is pretty fucking Irish all round.

**-What is a most famous Irish phrase, poem or short story, that I could tell in front of class? Prefferably in Irish, or with a very lousy accent.** 

Here's a short poem, well the first two verses anyway. Just to explain, ""Pint of plain"" = pint of Guinness or stout. ""Horse has also ran"" = the horse you placed a bet on came in 2nd or 3rd.

>When things go wrong and will not come right,
>Though you do the best you can,
>When life looks black as the hour of night –
>A pint of plain is your only man.

>When money’s tight and hard to get
>And your horse has also ran,
>When all you have is a heap of debt – 
>A pint of plain is your only man.

 - Flann O'Brien


**Finally, Is there a fun little interesting fact, event, person from Ireland that not many people outside of Ireland know of? Something that would make a class of 20 IT students go ""wow"" or just laugh their arses off.**

Ok, possibly interesting for IT students: Ireland had the first documented copyright dispute. Nearly 1500 years ago. I'll keep it as short as I can.

St Finian and St Columba got into a disagreement over a prayer book. Columba had borrowed the manuscript from Finian and secretly copied it with the intention of keeping the copy for his own use. But Finian said no, that this was theft--illegal copying! He demanded that Columba hand over the copy he had made.

Finian took the matter to the High King of Ireland, King Diarmait. Finian's argument was simple: My book. You can't copy it. 

Columba's response was pretty familiar to modern ears: that the book had not suffered by his copying. He argued that to not share knowledge was a far greater offense than to copy a book that lost nothing by being copied.

But the king ruled in Finian's favor, famously saying, ""To every cow belongs its calf; to every book its copy."" In other words, every copy of a book belonged to the owner of the original book.",0.9778,Positive

Brexit has been a factor for some of the long term shipments been compounded by the Liverpool port strikes in recent weeks (just been resolved)  Super zoo definitely has had shipments going through there. 

Also with the global food crisis allot of cheaper food cuts are been bought by poorer countries what we consider great for premium cat/dog food is going towards feeding the developing world. 

Now, I've seen a slowdown on freight volumes recently 6mos ago if i was a minute late submitting a missing digot on an ocean container i was kicked off the vessel. 

Now I can be 4 days late and they may still put me on the vessel, and I have people calling me up begging for work.
So the logistics slowdown i think is. Coming to an end.

We'll probably take another year to manage the restructuring because of the fallout of Ukraine on food production.
Wheat production in the UK this summer was high (but lower quality then we'd like for protein) which really buffered us. 

Other things that have had an impact is the CO2 shortage which was a stressful few weeks for all involved

TBH, the 15% spike i have seen in prices of pet food seemed conservative to some of the challanges I've seen in the industry (granted they may have been operating on inflated margins) which i think may be them preparing for the upcoming recession where they do not want to lose their Customer base when people will begin cutting back.",-0.9333,Negative

The worst that could happen is slightly less variety of packaged goods from the UK. The free movement of people predates the EU and I don't think its on the table, so the UK border should remain open.

Overall, while undoubtedly there are some risks or uncertainty if it goes badly, it's absolutely not necessarily to worry.

We sped up our opening up before the North last early June. And we gave them no warning that we were about to do that.

Ireland
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52937895

Northern Ireland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52925516

**WE** led to public pressure in Northern Ireland to reopen sooner. 

It wasn’t until July when we deferred a phase (again without consulting them) that the North was considerably less strict than us.

The difference between what we (as a whole island) did last summer and Zero Covid was just travel restrictions(Hotel quarantine) and **funding public health teams** and maintaining our expanded track and trace teams as part of that. If you look at genomic data from before the summer and after we can see that the covid that spread was reintroduced to Ireland. We did the long gruelling part of zero covid but we didn’t try to work with the North and the UK and do the final steps.

So I’m fed up with people using the North as a boogeyman while we do nothing to work with them. Which we should be doing no matter what strategy we adopt/continue with.

As for using them as an excuse now consider what will happen here if the North re-opens as soon as **their** vulnerable are vaccinated and they don’t try to control covid in younger groups. Cases there would skyrocket and people here would cross the border to go to pubs and shopping or to work there. Their hospitals would avoid being overwhelmed but we would need to impose restrictions on the border to stop ours from being overwhelmed. 

Now so far that is **not** what the North has planned. But I still see no evidence that we are working with them to encourage them not to.

Does that mean I think Covid Zero is achievable here? Probably not. So why consider trying? Because all of the building blocks are things we should be doing anyway:

1. Mandatory hotel quarantines

- We need that to prevent variants from arriving and we can at least match the UK policy. (Right now we’re actually a back door in to them)

2. Massively funding public health teams.

- This massively improves a suppression strategy and it’s hard to argue that that funding is wasted

3. a. We work with the UK and North on shared policies.

-If we can work with them we should and it will make any strategy better.

b. We curtail movement near the border

-If we actually try to work with them but they want to be much less strict we will need to curtail movement just for suppression. In suppression that’ll probably come as non-border counties being at a lower level than border counties.",-0.8577,Negative
2042,"I agree. I actually used to tweet in favour of it last year in August when they went to the dail committee. I got a bit icky about it when Tomas Ryan made this meme about grandchildren killing grannies (little red riding hood). Then cases got to 1000 and I was like nah.. its not feasible

2043,Taiwan is half the size of Ireland with more than 24.5 million people. There have been 9 deaths from Covid 19 and only 2 of those were local infections. All others were imported. No lockdown at any point except for extended school vacation at the very beginning. Haven't missed a day of work.

2044,"Very hard to compare 2 countries like Ireland and New Zealand, and not just because of the land border. Very different strategies for dealing with covid probably reduced our chances of ever going for it, i.e “Living with Covid” .

The main things are:

* Electricity: Highly variable, depends on whether your place will have electric heating, electric cooker, oven and shower, etc. Check this link out to get prices for the main electric companies https://www.bonkers.ie/compare-gas-electricity-prices/

* Gas: if some appliances are run on gas it might be good idea to get one energy company that covers both electric+gas (see link above)

* Water (right now there are no water charges, but these will be happening later this year or next. Prices aren't known). The old charges that are on hold for the time being were http://www.water.ie/billing-and-charges/charges/

* Internet: Depends on what speed you can afford and where you'll be staying. Check here for locations and prices: https://switcher.ie/broadband/

* Waste: Bins may be covered by your landlord, but if not you'll need to pay anywhere from €120-300 a year. This all depends on where you'll be living and what size bins are needed.  

* Other considerations:  
- If you're planning on working here, you'll need to get a PPS number as soon as you can.  http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Personal-Public-Service-Number-How-to-Apply.aspx

- Most employers and some letting agencies will only pay into an Irish account or accept pay from Irish account in €s. You'll probably need to get an Irish bank account. http://compare.consumerhelp.ie/CurrentAccount
